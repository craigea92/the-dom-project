# The Dom Project

## Project Description
I developed a 2-player dice roll game in this project, where a query selector determines the higher dice value and updates the H1 element on the webpage. The game can have a winner or a tie. The primary objective of this project was to update as many DOM elements as possible, with the exception of the roll dice button.

The challenging aspect of this project was determining how to update each element in the DOM. It provided an excellent opportunity to showcase my creativity with code.

At present, I consider this project to be complete, and I would not make any modifications. The knowledge I gained from this project will undoubtedly assist me on my journey to becoming a full-stack developer.

## What is the DOM?
The Document Object Model is a cross-platform and language-independent interface that treats an XML or HTML document as a tree structure wherein each node is an object representing a part of the document.
