# The Dom Project

## What is the DOM?
The Document Object Model is a cross-platform and language-independent interface that treats an XML or HTML document as a tree structure wherein each node is an object representing a part of the document.

In this project, I created a 2 player dice roll game. A query selector waits to see which dice is higher and then updates the H1 of the page. There can be a winner or a tie.
